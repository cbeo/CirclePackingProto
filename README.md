An [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org/) project that just demonstrates
drawing a path with the mouse such that, when the path intersects
itself, a closed figure is produced, trimming away the parts of the
path that are not part of that figure, and then filling the closed
path with circles of varying radii.

Just a prototype to prove a concept.

    # to build, do:
    openfl build neko

    # or 
    openfl build html5


(gif recorder set to an unbearably slow framerate it seems.)
